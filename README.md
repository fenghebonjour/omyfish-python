# OMyFish — Your AI Fishing Companion

**When, Where, What you catch.** An AI-powered companion for anglers, naturalists, and citizen scientists. Check the Timing forecast for the best hours to fish, photograph a fish for an instant species identification with ecological details, log the sighting with GPS coordinates, and track all your observations on a world map.

**Live demo:** [huggingface.co/spaces/fenghebonjour/omyfish](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fenghebonjour/omyfish)

> [!NOTE]
> **Repo reorganization (July 2026):** this repository was previously named `omyfish` — the old link `github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish` redirects here. The platform is now split into four repos: **omyfish-python** (this one), [omyfish-ai](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-ai), [omyfish-java](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-java), and [omyfish-dotnet](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-dotnet). See [Project Family](#project-family) below.

## Project Family

This repo is the **AI-first Python origin** of the OMyFish platform. Two enterprise re-architectures are being developed in parallel:

| Repo | Stack | Architecture |
|---|---|---|
| **omyfish-python** (this) | Python 3.11 · PyTorch · FastAPI · Streamlit | Monolith → service-oriented |
| [omyfish-dotnet](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-dotnet) | .NET 10 · ASP.NET Core · EF Core · YARP | Clean Architecture + CQRS (MediatR) |
| [omyfish-java](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-java) | Java 21 · Spring Boot 3.x · Hibernate · Spring AMQP | Hexagonal Architecture + Event-Driven |
| [omyfish-ai](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-ai) | Python 3.11 · PyTorch · FastAPI | Standalone AI microservice — shared by all three |

The shared AI microservice (`omyfish-ai`) wraps the EfficientNet-B3 predictor from this repo (`POST /predict`) and also hosts the Bite Score fishing-timing forecast engine (`GET /bite-score/*`), both consumed by all enterprise projects. All four share the same PostgreSQL/PostGIS + RabbitMQ + MinIO infrastructure stack.

## What it does

### Identify
Upload a photo and the AI returns the top-3 candidate species with confidence scores and a full ecological profile:

- Scientific name, habitat, diet
- Maximum recorded size
- Conservation status (color-coded: Least Concern → Endangered)
- Species description and a fun fact

The model knows 13 North American freshwater species (83.6 % val accuracy on EfficientNet-B3). A zero-shot CLIP fallback covers cases where no trained checkpoint is present.

### Log observations
After identification, save the sighting with a location:
- GPS coordinates are extracted automatically from the photo's EXIF data when available
- Manual entry for photos without GPS metadata
- Observations are stored in PostgreSQL (Supabase) with species, confidence, coordinates, and timestamp

### Map
All saved observations appear on an interactive world map (Folium). Switch to the **Map** tab to see every sighting — click a marker for species name, confidence, and timestamp.

### Timing
The **Timing** tab answers *when* to fish: an hourly Bite Score forecast (0–100) up to 14 days ahead for any location and species, with a daily outlook strip, Major/Minor peak windows, the six-factor breakdown behind every score (pressure, temperature, wind, water, solunar, sky), and storm/heavy-rain safety alerts. Served by the shared [omyfish-ai](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-ai) service.

### API
A FastAPI backend exposes the same capabilities programmatically:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /predict` | Raw top-K identification |
| `POST /identify-fish` | Identify + extract GPS + optionally save |
| `GET /observations` | List all stored sightings |
| `GET /observations/geojson` | GeoJSON export for external GIS tools |
| `GET /health` | Service health check |

---

## Modes

| Mode | When active | Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Fine-tuned** | `checkpoints/best.pt` present | EfficientNet-B3 trained on your dataset |
| **Zero-shot demo** | No checkpoint | CLIP (`openai/clip-vit-base-patch32`) |

Zero-shot requires no data or training. Fine-tuned mode delivers higher accuracy on the species you train on.

---

## Quick start (local)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Download the pre-trained weights (~46 MB) for fine-tuned mode
gh release download model-v1 --dir checkpoints/

make app          # Streamlit UI at http://localhost:8501
make api          # FastAPI at http://localhost:8000
```

The trained checkpoint is not stored in git — it's published as the
[`model-v1`](https://github.com/fenghebonjour/omyfish-python/releases/tag/model-v1)
release asset (`best.pt` + `classes.json`, both required for inference).
Skip the download to run in zero-shot CLIP mode instead, or run `make train`
to produce your own.

---

## Training a custom model

The training pipeline supports EfficientNet-B3, ResNet-50, and ViT. All hyperparameters live in `configs/training.yaml`.

```bash
# 1. Obtain labeled images — one folder per species
#    data/raw/<species_name>/*.jpg

# Download a public dataset (optional)
python research/scripts/download_data.py download crowww/a-large-scale-fish-dataset
python research/scripts/download_data.py organize data/kaggle_tmp --output data/raw

# Download North American freshwater species from iNaturalist
make download-na-freshwater

# 2. Train
make train                    # saves checkpoints/best.pt + classes.json

# 3. Resume an interrupted run
make resume

# 4. Evaluate
make eval                     # prints per-class report, saves outputs/confusion_matrix.png

# 5. Export for edge / mobile
python -c "from services.fish_ai.predictors.efficientnet import FishPredictor; \
           FishPredictor('checkpoints/best.pt').export_onnx()"
```

Once `checkpoints/best.pt` exists the app switches to fine-tuned mode automatically.

---

## Species knowledge base

`data/metadata/fish_info.json` contains profiles for 39 species. Each entry includes scientific name, habitat, diet, max size, conservation status, description, and a fun fact. Add entries here to enrich the identification cards shown in the UI.

---

## Persistent storage (Supabase)

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (or HuggingFace Space secret) to a PostgreSQL connection string. Use the **Connection Pooler → Session mode (port 5432)** URL for hosted environments like HF Spaces that lack IPv6 outbound access. The app falls back to SQLite when no `DATABASE_URL` is set.

---

## Deploy to HuggingFace Spaces

1. Create a Space — **SDK: Docker**, name: `omyfish`
2. Generate a write token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
3. Add it as a GitHub secret `HF_TOKEN`
4. Push to `main` — the GitHub Actions workflow deploys automatically
