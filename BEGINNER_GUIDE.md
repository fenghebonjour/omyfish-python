# Beginner's Guide to omyfish-python

Welcome to the omyfish-python project! This guide will help you understand the codebase quickly, whether you're new to machine learning or just new to *this* project.

## 🎯 What is omyfish?

**TL;DR:** A field companion for anglers and naturalists. Photograph a fish → AI identifies the species → log the sighting with GPS → view all observations on a world map.

**The system has four main parts:**
1. **AI Identifier** — A trained neural network that recognizes fish species and returns ecological details (in `services/fish_ai/`)
2. **Training Engine** — Code that teaches the model from your own labeled photos (in `services/fish_ai/training/`)
3. **Observation Logger** — Saves where and when you saw each fish, with GPS from EXIF or manual entry (in `apps/omyfish_api/`)
4. **User Interfaces** — A Streamlit web app for field use and a FastAPI REST API for integration (in `apps/`)

## 🧠 Core Concepts (The Essentials)

### What's a "Model"?
A model is a trained mathematical function. Think of it as an expert that learned from thousands of examples.

```
Training phase:
  Expert sees 1000 fish photos labeled with species
  → Learns: "Goldfish have X colors, Y shape"

Prediction phase:
  You show unknown photo
  → Expert says: "90% sure that's a goldfish"
```

### Training vs Inference
- **Training** = Teaching the model from examples (slow, happens once)
- **Inference** = Using the trained model to predict (fast, happens many times)

### Data Augmentation
The system artificially modifies training images to create more variety:
- Flip horizontally
- Add fog/blur (simulating underwater conditions)
- Adjust brightness/contrast

Why? So the model learns "goldfish is goldfish" regardless of conditions, not just from specific training examples.

### Class Imbalance
Some fish species have more training photos than others. The training code uses `WeightedRandomSampler` to handle this fairly.

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **The flow is:** Photo → AI identifies species → log sighting with GPS → view on map
2. **Everything is modular:** Each service/app is independent
3. **Configuration is centralized:** Most settings are in `configs/training.yaml`
4. **Two interfaces:** Web UI for field use, REST API (with GeoJSON export) for integration
5. **Works out of the box:** CLIP zero-shot mode requires no training data; swap in a fine-tuned checkpoint for higher accuracy

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run something:** `make app` or `make api` or `make predict IMAGE=test.jpg`
2. **Read the code:** Start with [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for a roadmap
3. **Modify & experiment:** Change a hyperparameter and retrain
4. **Ask questions:** Look at the code, search for patterns, trace imports

**Remember:** The best way to learn is by doing. Don't be afraid to read the actual code files!
